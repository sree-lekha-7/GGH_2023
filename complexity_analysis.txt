Time and Space Complexity of part1.py python File

Time Complexity:
1. Opening the circuit_file.txt and part2.py files takes constant time and can be ignored in the overall complexity analysis.
2. Iterating through each line in code and appending it to the part2.py file takes O(n) time, where n is the number of lines in the code list.
3. The if condition inside the loop and modifying the line of code takes constant time.
4. Printing the modified code to part2.py also takes constant time.
5. The last three print statements take constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of lines in the code list.

Space Complexity:
1. The code list stores each line from the circuit_file.txt file, so it requires space proportional to the number of lines in the file.
2. The part2.py file is opened in append mode, but since the code is being printed line by line, the space complexity is not dependent on the number of lines.
3. The str1 and str2 variables store constant-sized strings.
Therefore, the space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of lines in the circuit_file.txt file, as that is the major factor contributing to the space usage.

It's important to note that the analysis provided here assumes that the size of the code list is the same as the number of lines in the circuit_file.txt file. 
If the code list is constructed differently or modified during the execution of the code, the complexity analysis might change accordingly.

Time and Space Complexity of part2.py python File

Time Complexity:

1. Opening the circuit_file.txt and output.txt files takes constant time and can be ignored in the overall complexity analysis.
2. Reading the lines from circuit_file.txt and appending them to the code list takes O(n) time, where n is the number of lines in the file.
3. Iterating through each line in the code list takes O(m) time, where m is the number of lines in the code list.
4. Within the loop, there are multiple conditional statements, but each statement operates on a constant number of variables and performs constant operations, so the time complexity of each individual condition is constant.
5. The last three print statements take constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of this code is O(n + m), where n is the number of lines in circuit_file.txt and m is the number of lines in the code list.

Space Complexity:

1. The code list stores each line from the circuit_file.txt file, so it requires space proportional to the number of lines in the file.
2. The output list has a constant size of 4, as it represents the state of variables A, B, C, and D.
3. The variables A, B, C, D, FAULT_AT, and FAULT_TYPE require constant space.
4. The net_e, net_f, and net_g variables require constant space.
5. The Z variable requires constant space.
6. The output.txt file is opened in append mode, but since the data is being printed line by line, the space complexity is not dependent on the number of lines.
Therefore, the space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of lines in the circuit_file.txt file, as that is the major factor contributing to the space usage.

Please note that this analysis assumes that the size of the code list is the same as the number of lines in the circuit_file.txt file and does not take into account any additional memory usage or side effects caused by executing the code.
